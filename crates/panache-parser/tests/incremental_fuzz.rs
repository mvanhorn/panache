//! Seeded property harness for incremental reparsing.
//!
//! For every hazard snippet below, this harness applies pseudo-random edits
//! drawn from a hazard-biased insert alphabet (strings that can change block
//! structure at a distance) and asserts, per edit:
//!
//! 1. **Losslessness** — the incrementally reparsed tree round-trips to the
//!    edited text.
//! 2. **Structural identity** — its [`fingerprint`] equals a from-scratch
//!    parse of the edited text (in debug builds the in-crate oracle in
//!    `parser/verify.rs` checks the same invariant before we ever see the
//!    result; the comparison here also covers release runs).
//! 3. **Error identity** — its spliced syntax errors equal that parse's.
//!    Malformed YAML is the only error source there is, so the frontmatter
//!    and hashpipe snippets carry this half of the invariant.
//!
//! Chained batches additionally feed each spliced tree *and its errors* back
//! in as the next edit's base, mirroring how the LSP chains trees across
//! keystrokes.
//!
//! The generator is a plain LCG (MMIX constants) with fixed per-test seeds:
//! runs are fully deterministic, and every assertion message carries the
//! snippet name, seed, and edit so a failure is reproducible by copying the
//! reported case into a unit test. Iteration counts scale with the
//! `PANACHE_FUZZ_ITERS` environment variable (a multiplier; the default is
//! sized for `cargo test`).
//!
//! A failure here is an incremental-parser bug: minimize it into an
//! `#[ignore]`d red test (see the roadmap in `TODO.md`, "Incremental
//! Parsing") and fix it by adding a bail-to-full-parse condition — never by
//! relaxing these asserts.
//!
//! The hazard snippets are fuzzed with the window-size cutoff *off*
//! ([`CostGuards::Ignored`]). That cutoff declines any window covering more
//! than 85% of the document, which on snippets tens of bytes long is almost
//! every window: enforcing it here drops the share of edits that reach a splice
//! from 78% to 23%, and the guards this harness exists to test stop being
//! exercised. It is a *cost* guard with no soundness content, and the seams it
//! hides on a 30-byte snippet are the same seams that occur mid-document in a
//! real file, where the cutoff admits them. The real-document corpus below runs
//! with the production setting, so the shipped configuration is fuzzed too.
//!
//! Every driver tallies how many edits actually spliced and asserts a floor on
//! that share, because a harness whose edits all decline still passes every
//! invariant above while exercising nothing.
